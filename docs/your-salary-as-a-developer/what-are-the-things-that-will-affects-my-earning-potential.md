# Your earning potential

### What are the things that will affects my earning potential?

Salaries are affected by many factors, such as location, industry, individual background, language, perks and nature of work. Most developers are “fluent” in several languages which will affect the final figures as well.

For example, OfferZen’s latest [State of the Developer Nation Report](https://www.offerzen.com/reports/software-developer-south-africa/) has shown that:

- [Backend developers earn the highest average salaries,](https://bit.ly/34PCr83) followed by full stack and frontend developers.
- [Cape Town is still the best South African place for developer salaries](https://bit.ly/3oFqYz1) but Pretoria is catching up.
- [FinTech and Cloud Technology are the best paying](https://bit.ly/3HIhjzk) industries in South Africa.
- [The best paying programming languages](https://bit.ly/3BjJH8v) in South Africa are Go, Kotlin, and Ruby.
- [Female developers earn on average 17% less](https://bit.ly/3gCSpoS) than their male counterparts. [Read more thoughts on this here.](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/the-gender-pay-gap-in-tech)
