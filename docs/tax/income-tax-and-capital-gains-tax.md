# Income tax and capital gains tax

### What is the difference between income tax and capital gains tax?&#x20;

Income tax is levied on the income that one earns either by way of remuneration (eg. salary from a job) or trade (eg. consulting fees for an independent consultant).

Capital gains tax is levied on gains that arise from disposal of specific assets that a person has. For instance, if one had a secondary property that was rented for income and then sold that property for more than it was purchased for, a capital gain would result.

Capital gains does enter the income tax calculation, in that a specific percentage of capital gains are included in your taxable income when calculating income tax.
