# ðŸ’¸ Tax

In our quest to figure out what personal finance topics keep developers up at night, we realisd that tax questions are high up on the list.

Everyone's tax situation is different, so itâ€™s important to consult a professional, but there are some tax basics that every developer should know.

For example, did you know that you can claim a tax rebate if you work from home? In OfferZen's State of the Developer Nation Report, we found that 92% of developers in South Africa now have the option to work from home, so this is very likely applicable to you.
